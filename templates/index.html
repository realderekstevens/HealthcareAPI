<p>
Derek is a field advisor specializing in Medicare Supplement Plans, Medicare Advantage Plans, Medicare Part D Plans, Ancillary Plans - Hospital Indemnity, Cancer, Heart, Dental & Vision, Life Insurance, Long Term Care and Annuities.</br></br>
He gives clients an unfair advantage in retirement planning by talking with them about their structure and conducting a side-by-side comparison of all the options available to them. "My goal is to provide every client peace-of-mind by minimizing burdens and maximizing entitlements." He has a proven track record of helping hundreds of clients audit their policies.</br></br>
He also has a lot of information on long-term care and 403(b) plans. "I know a lot about healthcare expenses because I used to bill for them." He is also an active member of several 403(b) hospital retirement plans and the Colorado teacher retirement PERA plan.</br></br>
Derek grew up in Taos, New Mexico. He studied economics at the University of New Mexico while working as nurse aid.
